# NHLGoaliesAnalysis
This repository includes data collection and analysis for NHL goalies in the NHL.  So far I have done the data collection and saved the dataframe as a CSV.  Check back later for more updates.  Thanks!

Contents:
1. Goalie Data Collection
2. Goalies From 1950-2020 Narrowing the scope
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (single variable Analysis)


And associated .csv files as saved in notebooks.

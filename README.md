# NHLGoaliesAnalysis
This repository includes data collection and analysis for NHL goalies in the NHL.  So far I have done the data collection and saved the dataframe as a CSV.  Check back later for more updates.  Thanks!

Contents:
1. Goalie Data Collection
2. Goalies From 1950-2020 Narrowing the scope
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (single variable Analysis)
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (comparing multiple variables)
5. Hall of Fame Predictor Model
6. Improved Hall of Fame Predictor Model.

And associated .csv files as saved in notebooks.

Keep in mind that this was just a project done to hone some skills and have a little fun predicting whether goalies would get into the hall of fame.  If I wanted to continue improving the model (and perhaps I will in the future), I would include playoff data, world/olympic championships, make a GridSearchCV in order to find both the best type of model and best hyperparameters, and would probably try to do some dimensionality reduction as well as weighting the features differently.  In a perfect world, we would have a train test split, but the data set was quite large with respect to the relatively small number of hall of fame goalies.  If you made it this far, thanks for looking!
